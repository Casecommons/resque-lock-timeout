module Resque
  module Plugins
    # If you want only one instance of your job running at a time,
    # extend it with this module:
    #
    # require 'resque-lock'
    #
    # class UpdateNetworkGraph
    #   extend Resque::Plugins::Lock
    #
    #   def self.perform(repo_id)
    #     heavy_lifting
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # While other UpdateNetworkGraph jobs will be placed on the queue,
    # the Lock class will check Redis to see if any others are
    # executing with the same arguments before beginning. If another
    # is executing the job will be aborted.
    #
    # If you want to define the key yourself you can override the
    # `identifier` or `lock` method in your subclass, e.g.
    #
    # class UpdateNetworkGraph
    #   extend Resque::Plugins::Lock
    #
    #   # Run only one at a time, regardless of repo_id.
    #   def self.identifier(repo_id)
    #     "network-graph"
    #   end
    #
    #   def self.perform(repo_id)
    #     heavy_lifting
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # The above modification will ensure only one job of class
    # UpdateNetworkGraph is running at a time, regardless of the
    # repo_id. Normally a job is locked using a combination of its
    # class name and arguments.
    #
    # If you wish to limit the duration a lock may be held for, you can
    # set/override `lock_timeout`. e.g.
    #
    # class UpdateNetworkGraph
    #   extend Resque::Plugins::Lock
    #
    #   # lock may be held for upto an hour.
    #   @lock_timeout = 3600
    #
    #   def self.perform(repo_id)
    #     heavy_lifting
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # Several callbacks are available to override and implement
    # your own logic, e.g.
    #
    # class UpdateNetworkGraph
    #   extend Resque::Plugins::Lock
    #
    #   # Lock may be held for upto an hour.
    #   @lock_timeout = 3600
    #
    #   # Job failed to acquire lock. You may implement retry or other logic.
    #   def self.lock_failed(repo_id)
    #     retry_using_delay
    #   end
    #
    #   # Job has complete; but the lock expired before we could relase it.
    #   # The lock wasn't released; as its *possible* the lock is now held
    #   # by another job.
    #   def self.lock_expired_before_release(repo_id)
    #     handle_if_needed
    #   end
    #
    #   def self.perform(repo_id)
    #     heavy_lifting
    #   end
